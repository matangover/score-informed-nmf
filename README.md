# Score-informed NMF

This repository contains an implementation of score-informed source separation using non-negative matrix factorization. It was created as part of my Master's thesis on score-informed source separation of choral music. The code is a direct implementation of the technique described in the following paper ([PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6287834)):
